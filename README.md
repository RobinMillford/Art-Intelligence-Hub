# Art Intelligence Hub: An Ensemble Deep Learning Project

This project is a **college capstone project** featuring a multi-page Streamlit application that showcases advanced deep learning models for art analysis. It includes two main tools: an **Artwork Authenticity** classifier to distinguish between AI-generated and human-made art, and an **Art Style Ensemble Classifier** that identifies the artistic style of a painting.

The app is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for public access, enabling users to upload images and receive robust, interpretable predictions.

## üî• Features

- **Dual Classifier App**: A multi-page interface with two distinct art analysis tools.
- **Artwork Authenticity Classification**:
  - Predicts whether an image is AI-generated or real art using a fine-tuned `MobileNetV2`.
  - Includes **Grad-CAM heatmap visualization** to highlight the image regions that influenced the model's prediction.
- **Art Style Ensemble Classification**:
  - Identifies an artwork's style from 10 categories (e.g., _Impressionism_, _Surrealism_).
  - Combines the predictions of two powerful models (`EfficientNetV2-B2` and `ConvNeXt-Small`) for a more accurate and reliable result.
- **Interpretability**:
  - The "Art Style" page visualizes each model's top 3 predictions in a bar chart, showing its confidence and alternative considerations.
- **Modern, Interactive UI**:
  - A clean, dark-themed interface for a professional user experience.

## üß† Model Details

This project leverages three powerful, fine-tuned models:

1.  **Artwork Authenticity Model**:
    - **Base Model**: `MobileNetV2` (Transfer Learning)
    - **Task**: Binary classification (AI Art or Real Art).
2.  **Art Style Ensemble Models**:
    - **Model A**: `EfficientNetV2-B2`
    - **Model B**: `ConvNeXt-Small`
    - **Task**: Multi-class classification (10 art styles).
    - **Ensemble Strategy**: The final prediction is the averaged probability (soft voting) from both models.

## üìì Kaggle Notebook

The model training and experimentation were conducted in a Kaggle Notebook. Key highlights include:

- **Dataset Preparation**:
  - Combined multiple datasets, including real art and AI-generated art (`Stable Diffusion` & `Midjourney`), totaling over **150,000 images**.
  - The final dataset was split into **80% training**, **10% validation**, and **10% test** sets.
- **Model Experimentation**:
  - Fine-tuned three separate deep learning architectures (`MobileNetV2`, `EfficientNetV2-B2`, `ConvNeXt-Small`) using a two-stage transfer learning approach.
  - Utilized modern training techniques such as the `AdamW` optimizer, learning rate scheduling, and advanced data augmentation.
- **Key Insights**:
  - The ensemble approach for style classification leverages the architectural diversity of `EfficientNetV2` (a powerful CNN) and `ConvNeXt-Small` (a modern hybrid) to achieve higher accuracy than either model alone.
  - `MobileNetV2` was chosen for the authenticity task due to its lightweight and efficient design, making it ideal for a fast, responsive app.
